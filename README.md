# CISC-3440-Project
CISC 3440 Machine Learning course project

This project was to compare models trained on CIFAR-10. I compared a custom made CNN from techniques learned from class, the ResNet-50 model re purposed for CIFAR-10, and MobileNet re purposed for CIFAR-10. ResNet and MobileNet were created using Tensorflow's functional model while the CNN was made using TensorFlow's sequential model.
